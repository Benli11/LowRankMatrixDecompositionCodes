These codes are included to illustrate versions 1 - 3 of the RSVD 
algorithms and the autorank methods. The codes can be executed with Octave or Matlab.
Note: for current versions of Octave, change qr(Y,0) to qr(Y,'0').

First make a matrix via one of the make_matrix scripts. Next run 
the script test_rsvd1.m to run version I, II, or III of the randomized algorithms.
Run the test_multks scripts to run over multiple ks; plotters make plots.
Use test_rsvd2_autorank to run the autorank methods.
